\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}



% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.





% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx

\usepackage{enumitem}


% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that

% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\begin{abstract}
    \textbf{Context}: In the software lifecycle, the market introduction phase presents significant challenges related to business model definition and selection. This raises questions such as which business models are available, which are most commonly adopted, which best fit the proposed solution, what benefits and limitations they present, and how to choose the most appropriate model.
    \textbf{Objective}: This study aims to map and categorize software business models, providing a structured view that supports understanding, comparison, and strategic selection.
    \textbf{Method}: A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted using primary studies from the last decade (2014--2024) indexed in the ACM, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus digital libraries. Data extraction employed 33 extraction questions (12 closed-ended and 21 open-ended), with qualitative analysis using a coding scheme of 61 codes organized in 9 classes.
    \textbf{Results}: The search retrieved 2,889 studies, with 216 removed as duplicates. After title and abstract screening, 312 studies were considered potentially relevant, and the full-text quality assessment resulted in 67 studies included in the final synthesis. The analysis identified platform-based models (391 mentions), SaaS (289), freemium (264), and open source (188) as the most prevalent. Subscription-based revenue dominated at 76.1\%, with multi-tenant SaaS present in 71.6\% of studies. Key success factors include ecosystem management (138 mentions) and market expansion (84), while main challenges involve security concerns (41) and revenue stream transformation (38).
    \textbf{Conclusion}: The consolidated results provide a three-dimensional taxonomy (delivery, monetization, ecosystem) and serve as conceptual foundation for developing an ontology to represent software business models, contributing to the systematization of knowledge and supporting evidence-based strategic decision-making.

%
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:

\IEEEPARstart{O}{} desenvolvimento de software é um processo dinâmico que vai além da criação de código ou da entrega de funcionalidades. No ciclo de vida do software, a fase de inserção no mercado se apresenta como um momento crucial, no qual as decisões relacionadas à monetização e à sustentabilidade financeira precisam ser cuidadosamente planejadas. Nesse contexto, a modelagem de negócios desempenha um papel central, oferecendo estruturas para alinhar os objetivos estratégicos da organização com as necessidades do mercado.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)

Diferentes modelos de negócios, como o licenciamento, o modelo \textit{freemium} ou o software como serviço (SaaS), têm sido amplamente explorados na indústria de software. Entretanto, a escolha do modelo mais adequado para um produto específico envolve a consideração de diversos fatores, como tendências de mercado, desafios de implementação e práticas eficazes para mitigar riscos. Além disso, a literatura sobre modelos de negócios frequentemente aborda aspectos variados, dificultando a identificação de abordagens emergentes e bem-sucedidas no setor.

Dada essa complexidade, este estudo tem como objetivo explorar os modelos de negócios aplicados à indústria de software por meio de uma revisão sistemática da literatura (RSL) dos últimos 10 anos (2014–2024). A pesquisa busca responder a perguntas fundamentais sobre quais modelos têm sido utilizados, quais fatores influenciam sua escolha e quais práticas foram eficazes na superação de desafios de implementação. Para tanto, foram definidos critérios rigorosos para seleção, avaliação e extração de dados, garantindo a qualidade e a relevância dos estudos analisados.

Os resultados deste trabalho visam contribuir para a criação de uma ontologia que apoie tanto pesquisadores quanto profissionais na escolha e implementação de modelos de negócios eficazes para produtos de software. Ao compreender as características, fatores de sucesso e desafios de cada abordagem, este estudo fornece \textit{insights} valiosos para decisões estratégicas na indústria de software.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:methodology} presents the methodology used, including the research questions, selection criteria, and extraction strategy; Section~\ref{sec:analysis} presents the analysis of results organized by research question; Section~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses the main findings and their implications; Section~\ref{sec:threats} addresses threats to validity; and Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} presents conclusions and future work.

\section{Metodologia}\label{sec:methodology} %Protocolo e as etapas da execução
    \IEEEPARstart{E}{xistem} diversas diretrizes propostas para a realização de Revisão Sistemática da Literatura (RSL) e Mapeamento Sistemático da Literatura (MSL), como as apresentadas por \cite{keele2007guidelines}, \cite{engstrom2011software} e \cite{petersen2008systematic}.
    Este estudo seguiu principalmente as diretrizes descritas por \cite{petersen2008systematic}, que estabelecem um processo estruturado para identificar lacunas de pesquisa, classificar e mapear os artigos encontrados.
    De acordo com os autores, o mapeamento sistemático deve seguir o processo ilustrado na Figura~\ref{fig:protocol}.

    \begin{figure}[!htb]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=3.2in]{img/protocol.png}
        \caption{Processo de Mapeamento Sistemático \cite{petersen2008systematic}}
        \label{fig:protocol}
    \end{figure}

    A primeira etapa do processo consiste em definir as questões de pesquisa, permitindo a identificação de palavras-chave para a busca nas bases de dados. Em seguida, os artigos que não atendem aos critérios de inclusão, definidos com base nas perguntas de pesquisa, são filtrados. Os artigos restantes são classificados com base nas palavras-chave encontradas, especialmente nos resumos. A partir dos dados extraídos dos artigos, é construído um mapa sistemático, que pode incluir gráficos e tabelas para ilustrar os resultados, conforme descrito por \cite{petersen2008systematic}.

    \caption{Research Questions}
    \label{fig:RQs}
\end{figure}

These questions guided the search for relevant studies, enabling the identification of applied business models and contextual factors that influence the success of each approach.

Desenvolvemos a estratégia de busca com base nos termos relacionados ao tema ``modelos de negócios em software'' e seus sinônimos. Assim, adotamos os seguintes passos:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fontes de Dados:} As bases de dados selecionadas para a coleta de estudos foram ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore e Scopus;
    \item \textbf{Termos de Busca:} Foram utilizados os termos ``Business model'' e ``Software'', combinados com operadores \textit{booleanos} para otimizar os resultados;
    \item \textbf{Período de Pesquisa:} Foram considerados estudos publicados entre 2014 e 2024, abrangendo a última década;
    \item \textbf{Linguagem:} Apenas estudos redigidos em inglês foram incluídos na pesquisa, assegurando uniformidade na análise.
\end{itemize}

Para ampliar a abrangência da pesquisa, sinônimos e termos relacionados ao tema foram identificados e organizados na Tabela~\ref{tab:terms-synonyms}. Essa tabela serviu como base para a construção da \textit{string} de busca utilizada nas bases de dados.
A \textit{string} foi elaborada com o uso de operadores \textit{booleanos} (\texttt{AND}, \texttt{OR}) para garantir a precisão e a relevância dos resultados.
A formulação final da \textit{string} é apresentada na Figura \ref{fig:String}.
A aplicação dessa \textit{string} nas bases de dados resultou na coleta de estudos alinhados aos objetivos do trabalho.

\end{figure}

Essa abordagem assegurou a abrangência e a relevância na seleção dos estudos, permitindo a identificação de publicações pertinentes ao tema investigado.

\subsection{Critérios de Seleção dos Estudos}\label{sec:study-selection-criteria}
Os critérios de seleção foram estabelecidos para garantir a relevância e a qualidade dos estudos incluídos na revisão:

%\begin{itemize}
\textbf{Critérios de Inclusão (CI):}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{CI\arabic*.}]
        \item \textbf{Disponibilidade de Acesso:} Estudos que estejam integralmente acessíveis para análise;

        \item \textbf{Profundidade Mínima:} Estudos com, no mínimo, seis páginas, garantindo discussões mais detalhadas e fundamentadas;

        \item \textbf{Foco em Modelos de Negócios para Software:} Estudos que tratem explicitamente de modelos de negócios aplicados à indústria de software, incluindo abordagens práticas, teóricas ou híbridas.
    \end{enumerate}

\textbf{Critérios de Exclusão (CE):}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{CE\arabic*.}]
        \item \textbf{Documentos Incompletos:} Trabalhos com acesso restrito, resumos estendidos, apresentações ou \textit{posters};

        \item \textbf{Resumos e Resumos Expandidos:} Trabalhos com menos de seis páginas, por não apresentarem profundidade analítica suficiente;

        \item \textbf{Foco Técnico Excessivo:} Estudos cujo tema principal seja técnico (como arquiteturas, algoritmos ou desempenho do software), nos quais os modelos de negócios tenham papel secundário ou irrelevante.
        % \item
    \end{enumerate}
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Critérios de Qualidade dos Estudos}\label{sec:study-quality-criteria}
Para avaliar a qualidade dos estudos selecionados, foram definidas as seguintes Questões de Qualidade (QQ), que servem como base para clarificar e aplicar os critérios de avaliação:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{QQ\arabic*.}]
    \item O estudo apresenta um modelo de negócio específico para software? (Peso 4\label{qq:01})
    \item O estudo justifica a escolha de um modelo de negócio com base em fatores relevantes? (Peso 1\label{qq:02})
    \item O estudo identifica modelo(s) de negócio como tendências emergentes na literatura recente? (Peso 1)
    \item O estudo discute fatores de sucesso e desafios enfrentados por empresas de software na implementação de modelos de negócio? (Peso 1)
    \item O estudo apresenta práticas para mitigar os desafios relacionados à implementação de modelos de negócios de software? (Peso 1\label{qq:05})
    \item O estudo descreve de forma detalhada as características dos modelos de negócio analisados? (Peso 2\label{qq:06})
\end{enumerate}

A avaliação da qualidade dos estudos foi estruturada para priorizar as informações mais relevantes aos objetivos da pesquisa. A Questão de Qualidade~\ref{qq:01} foi definida como obrigatória, pois é essencial que cada estudo analise pelo menos um modelo de negócio aplicado a software. A Questão de Qualidade~\ref{qq:06} também possui destaque, pois contribui com uma descrição detalhada das características dos modelos apresentados. As demais questões (\textbf{\ref{qq:02}–\ref{qq:05}}) são consideradas complementares e enriquecem a análise, embora sua ausência não comprometa diretamente a qualidade do estudo na revisão.

Para classificar os estudos com base em sua qualidade, foram definidos pesos para cada questão de qualidade e uma escala que categoriza os estudos em seis níveis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Péssimo:} 0 a 0.99 pontos.
    \item \textbf{Ruim:} 1 a 1.99 pontos.
    \item \textbf{Regular:} 2 a 3.99 pontos.
    \item \textbf{Bom:} 4 a 5.99 pontos.
    \item \textbf{Muito Bom:} 6 a 7.99 pontos.
    \item \textbf{Excelente:} 8 a 10 pontos.
\end{itemize}

A pontuação final de cada estudo é calculada com base nos pesos atribuídos a cada questão de qualidade, permitindo uma avaliação objetiva e sistemática. Dessa forma, estudos classificados como ``Excelente'' são incluídos na síntese final, garantindo maior relevância e profundidade aos resultados da pesquisa.

\subsection{Estratégia de Extração dos Dados}\label{sec:data-extraction-strategy}

Data extraction was performed based on the previously defined research questions.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Condução}\label{sec:execution}

A condução deste estudo teve início no final de novembro de 2024, seguindo o protocolo descrito e ilustrado na Figura~\ref{fig:protocol}.
Para apoiar as fases de planejamento e condução da MSL, foram utilizadas ferramentas complementares.
A principal ferramenta empregada foi o \textit{Thoth}, em sua segunda versão\footnote{\url{https://thoth-slr.com/}}.
Entretanto, devido ao fato de o \textit{Thoth} ainda estar em fase de desenvolvimento e testes, o \textit{Google Sheets}\footnote{\url{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/?usp=sheets_ald}} foi utilizado como recurso adicional para garantir a organização e o gerenciamento eficiente dos dados.

Para todas as bases de dados selecionadas, a busca foi limitada aos campos ``Abstract'' e ``Title'', a fim de aumentar a precisão dos resultados e evitar artigos irrelevantes.
Adicionalmente, filtros de datas foram aplicados diretamente nas bases de dados, restringindo o intervalo de publicações ao período de 2014 a 2024.

A Figura~\ref{fig:papers-per-db} demonstra que a aplicação da estratégia de busca resultou no retorno de 2.889 artigos no total, distribuídos entre as três bases de dados selecionadas: ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore e Scopus.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \input{tikz/papers_per_db}
    \caption{Estudos por Base de Dados.}
    \label{fig:papers-per-db}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Seleção dos Estudos}\label{sec:study-selection}
Na primeira fase da seleção, foram identificados e removidos 216 artigos duplicados. Em seguida, os critérios de inclusão e exclusão foram aplicados através da análise de títulos e resumos. Como resultado dessa triagem, 312 estudos foram considerados potencialmente relevantes e selecionados para leitura completa na fase seguinte.

\subsubsection{Avaliação de Qualidade dos Estudos}\label{sec:quality-evaluation}
Dos 312 estudos potencialmente relevantes, 138 foram submetidos à leitura completa e avaliação de qualidade com base nas Questões de Qualidade (QQ) definidas na Seção~\ref{sec:study-quality-criteria}. Após essa análise rigorosa, 67 estudos foram classificados como ``Excelente'' e aceitos para inclusão na síntese final, atendendo plenamente aos critérios de qualidade estabelecidos e apresentando contribuições relevantes para responder às questões de pesquisa.

A Figura~\ref{fig:quality-papers-evaluation} apresenta a distribuição dos 138 estudos de acordo com a classificação obtida na avaliação de qualidade. Dos estudos avaliados, 67 (48,6\%) foram classificados como ``Excelente'', 24 (17,4\%) como ``Muito Bom'', 3 (2,2\%) como ``Bom'', 4 (2,9\%) como ``Regular'', 1 (0,7\%) como ``Ruim'' e 39 (28,3\%) como ``Péssimo''.

    \centering
    \input{tikz/quality_classification}
    \caption{Classificação dos Estudos na Avaliação de Qualidade.}
    \label{fig:quality-papers-evaluation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Extração de Dados}\label{sec:data-extraction}
A extração de dados foi realizada nos 67 estudos incluídos, utilizando um formulário estruturado com 33 questões de extração (QE), organizadas em questões fechadas (12 questões com categorias predefinidas) e questões abertas (21 questões para captura de informações qualitativas). A taxa de resposta variou conforme a natureza da questão: questões sobre identificação do modelo, contexto de aplicação e fatores de sucesso obtiveram taxas próximas a 100\%, enquanto questões mais específicas sobre licenciamento e periodicidade de cobrança apresentaram taxas menores (37-39\%), indicando que nem todos os estudos abordam esses aspectos operacionais.

Para a análise qualitativa das questões abertas, foi desenvolvido um esquema de codificação com 61 códigos organizados em 9 classes e 35 subclasses, resultando em 4.630 classificações de \textit{quotes} extraídas dos estudos. Esse processo de codificação permitiu identificar padrões, categorizar conceitos recorrentes e estabelecer relações entre os diferentes aspectos dos modelos de negócios analisados.

\section{Discussão dos Resultados}\label{sec:discussion}

Esta seção discute as principais descobertas da revisão sistemática, apresentando uma síntese integrada dos resultados e suas implicações para pesquisadores e profissionais.

\subsection{Síntese dos Principais Achados}

A análise dos 67 estudos revelou um panorama rico e diversificado dos modelos de negócios de software. A predominância do modelo SaaS (76,1\% dos estudos mencionando \textit{subscription} como fonte de receita) confirma a transformação fundamental ocorrida na indústria de software na última década. Este modelo oferece vantagens tanto para fornecedores --- receita recorrente previsível, redução de pirataria, ciclos de atualização contínuos --- quanto para clientes --- menor investimento inicial, escalabilidade e acesso a atualizações constantes.

A forte presença de modelos de plataforma (391 menções) e os efeitos de rede associados (133 menções) evidenciam a importância crescente dos ecossistemas no mercado de software. Empresas bem-sucedidas não apenas vendem produtos, mas orquestram ecossistemas que conectam desenvolvedores, usuários e parceiros, criando valor através de efeitos de rede positivos.

O modelo \textit{freemium} (264 menções) emergiu como estratégia relevante, particularmente em mercados B2C e aplicativos móveis. Esta abordagem reduz barreiras de entrada para usuários, permitindo experimentação antes da conversão para versões pagas. Entretanto, os estudos indicam que o sucesso do \textit{freemium} depende de configurações específicas de fatores, não sendo universalmente aplicável.

\subsection{Padrões e Correlações Identificados}

A análise cruzada dos dados revelou padrões importantes:

\subsubsection{Correlação entre Tipo de Cliente e Canais de Aquisição}

Modelos B2B tendem a utilizar vendas diretas (75\%) e parceiros de canal (61\%), enquanto modelos B2C privilegiam \textit{Product-led Growth} (68\%), marketing digital (54\%) e marketplaces (39\%). Esta diferenciação reflete as distintas jornadas de compra e processos decisórios de cada segmento.

\subsubsection{Correlação entre Papel no Ecossistema e Efeitos de Rede}

Empresas com papel de plataforma bilateral (\textit{Two-sided platform}) apresentam predominantemente efeitos de rede cruzados (76\%), enquanto produtos \textit{standalone} mostram distribuição mais variada entre efeitos diretos (50\%) e ausência de efeitos de rede (30\%).

\subsubsection{Evolução dos Modelos de Precificação}

Os dados indicam uma evolução de modelos baseados em licenciamento perpétuo (14 menções) para modelos de assinatura (153 menções) e consumo (40 menções). Esta transição representa uma mudança fundamental na relação entre fornecedores e clientes, de transação única para relacionamento contínuo.

\subsection{Comparação com Literatura Prévia}

Os resultados desta revisão confirmam e expandem achados de estudos anteriores sobre modelos de negócios de software. A predominância do SaaS corrobora as previsões de crescimento identificadas em estudos do início da década. A importância dos efeitos de rede, destacada por \cite{keele2007guidelines}, foi confirmada empiricamente, com mais de um terço dos estudos identificando algum tipo de efeito de rede.

A identificação de desafios relacionados à transformação do fluxo de receita e à disrupção do ecossistema de parceiros adiciona detalhamento à literatura existente sobre transições de modelo de negócio. A literatura prévia frequentemente focava nos benefícios da migração para SaaS, enquanto esta revisão equilibra a perspectiva ao documentar sistematicamente os desafios enfrentados.

\subsection{Taxonomia Emergente}

Com base na análise, propõe-se uma taxonomia de modelos de negócios de software organizada em três dimensões principais:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Dimensão de Entrega}: Como o software é disponibilizado (SaaS multi-tenant, single-tenant, on-premises, híbrido, mobile).

    \item \textbf{Dimensão de Monetização}: Como a receita é gerada (subscription, usage-based, freemium, perpetual license, advertising, transaction fees).

    \item \textbf{Dimensão de Ecossistema}: Qual o papel da empresa e os mecanismos de criação de valor (standalone product, two-sided platform, marketplace, plugin/complement).
\end{enumerate}

Esta taxonomia permite classificar e comparar modelos de negócios de software de forma sistemática, facilitando a análise de opções estratégicas para empresas do setor.

\subsection{Implicações para a Prática}

Para profissionais e gestores de empresas de software, os resultados sugerem:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Estratégia de transição gradual}: A adoção de modelos híbridos durante períodos de transição reduz riscos e permite ajustes baseados em feedback do mercado.

    \item \textbf{Investimento em ecossistema}: O gerenciamento eficaz de parceiros e stakeholders é o fator de sucesso mais citado, indicando a necessidade de investimentos nessa área.

    \item \textbf{Flexibilidade de precificação}: Estratégias de precificação flexíveis que acomodem diferentes perfis de clientes são essenciais para maximizar adoção e receita.

    \item \textbf{Atenção à segurança}: Preocupações com segurança são a principal barreira identificada, exigindo investimentos em certificações, transparência e comunicação.

    \item \textbf{Alinhamento canal-cliente}: A escolha de canais de aquisição deve estar alinhada com o tipo de cliente-alvo (B2B vs. B2C).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implicações para a Pesquisa}

Para pesquisadores, os achados indicam:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Lacuna em estudos experimentais}: Apenas 3\% dos estudos utilizaram métodos experimentais, indicando oportunidade para pesquisas que estabeleçam relações causais.

    \item \textbf{Subexploração de marketplaces cloud}: O baixo percentual de estudos sobre AWS Marketplace, Azure Marketplace e similares (3\% cada) sugere área emergente para investigação.

    \item \textbf{Necessidade de estudos longitudinais}: A maioria dos estudos apresenta visões transversais; estudos longitudinais sobre evolução de modelos de negócios são necessários.

    \item \textbf{Integração com sustentabilidade}: A emergência de modelos de negócios digitais sustentáveis representa fronteira de pesquisa promissora.
\end{enumerate}





\section{Ameaças à Validade do Estudo}\label{sec:threats}

Esta seção discute as principais ameaças à validade deste estudo, organizadas conforme as categorias propostas por \cite{petersen2008systematic}.

\subsection{Validade de Construto}

A validade de construto refere-se à adequação das medidas utilizadas para capturar os conceitos investigados.

\textbf{Definição das questões de pesquisa}: As questões de pesquisa foram definidas com base em revisões prévias da literatura e validadas através de discussões entre os pesquisadores. Entretanto, a amplitude das questões pode ter resultado em respostas heterogêneas, dificultando a síntese.

\textbf{Formulário de extração}: O formulário com 33 questões de extração foi desenvolvido iterativamente e testado em um subconjunto de estudos antes da aplicação completa. Apesar disso, algumas questões apresentaram taxas de resposta baixas (37-39\% para questões sobre licenciamento e periodicidade de cobrança), indicando possível desalinhamento entre as questões e o conteúdo dos estudos.

\textbf{Esquema de codificação}: Os 61 códigos utilizados na análise qualitativa foram desenvolvidos de forma iterativa através de processo indutivo-dedutivo. A validade da codificação foi verificada através de revisão cruzada de uma amostra de classificações.

\subsection{Validade Interna}

A validade interna refere-se à confiabilidade dos processos de condução do estudo.

\textbf{Viés de seleção}: A seleção de estudos foi realizada seguindo critérios predefinidos. Entretanto, a triagem de 2.889 artigos por um único pesquisador na fase inicial pode ter introduzido viés. Para mitigar esse risco, casos duvidosos foram discutidos com co-pesquisadores.

\textbf{Viés de extração}: A extração de dados foi realizada por um pesquisador, com verificação amostral por um segundo pesquisador. A taxa de concordância foi satisfatória, mas divergências pontuais podem ter ocorrido em casos ambíguos.

\textbf{Codificação qualitativa}: A atribuição de códigos às quotes extraídas envolveu julgamento interpretativo. Para aumentar a confiabilidade, foram desenvolvidas descrições detalhadas para cada código e realizadas revisões periódicas de consistência.

\subsection{Validade Externa}

A validade externa refere-se à generalização dos resultados.

\textbf{Escopo temporal}: O estudo limitou-se a publicações de 2014 a 2024, período que captura a maturação do modelo SaaS mas pode não refletir tendências mais recentes, como modelos baseados em inteligência artificial generativa.

\textbf{Escopo de bases de dados}: Foram utilizadas três bases de dados (ACM, IEEE Xplore, Scopus). Embora representativas da literatura em engenharia de software e sistemas de informação, estudos publicados em outras fontes (conferências de gestão, literatura cinzenta) podem não ter sido capturados.

\textbf{Viés de publicação}: Estudos publicados tendem a reportar resultados positivos ou significativos, potencialmente sub-representando experiências de fracasso ou resultados neutros na implementação de modelos de negócios.

\textbf{Contexto geográfico e industrial}: Os estudos analisados apresentam predominância de contextos norte-americanos e europeus, e de setores como aplicativos móveis e plataformas empresariais. A generalização para outros contextos deve ser feita com cautela.

\subsection{Confiabilidade}

A confiabilidade refere-se à possibilidade de replicação do estudo.

\textbf{Documentação do protocolo}: O protocolo de pesquisa foi documentado detalhadamente, incluindo string de busca, critérios de inclusão/exclusão e questões de extração. Os dados brutos e códigos de análise estão disponíveis em repositório público para verificação.

\textbf{Ferramentas utilizadas}: O uso combinado de ferramentas (Thoth e Google Sheets) para gerenciamento dos dados pode dificultar a replicação exata. Entretanto, os procedimentos foram documentados para permitir reprodução equivalente.

\subsection{Mitigações Adotadas}

Para mitigar as ameaças identificadas, foram adotadas as seguintes estratégias:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Definição prévia e documentação do protocolo de pesquisa;
    \item Desenvolvimento iterativo do formulário de extração com teste piloto;
    \item Criação de esquema de codificação hierárquico com definições explícitas;
    \item Revisão cruzada de amostras de seleção, extração e codificação;
    \item Disponibilização dos dados e materiais em repositório aberto;
    \item Triangulação de dados quantitativos (questões fechadas) e qualitativos (questões abertas).
\end{itemize}

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
