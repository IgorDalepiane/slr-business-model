Compared to the generalized market orientation, specialized market orientation implies that the usage variations among clients are less and the accumulation of expertise becomes relatively easy to achieve. This benefits vendors by supporting them to improve the quality of software services and create and deliver value-added client service. Also, specialized market orientation benefits SaaS vendors with extra revenues by allowing them to fine-tune licensing models towards varied usages of software services' | Page 6: 'when usage-independent based components were adopted, vendors usually complement them with discount options for pre-pay or bulk-pay subscribers'",
