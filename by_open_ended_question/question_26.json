Yet, given the nature of SaaS as remotely hosted software services, switching is neither expensive nor tedious for clients' | Page 2: 'The second challenge comes from the diversity of SaaS clients, among which small and medium enterprises have been the most aggressive adopters. Likewise, large corporations are equally attracted to the idea of acquiring software services on demand. Moreover, diversities are also found in the industries within which SaaS clients are situated. Such diversity translates to conflicting functional requirements and the need for SaaS vendors to tailor licenses to match these firm-specific requirements' | Page 2: 'The third challenge resides in clients' varied usage of software services' | Page 3: 'from SaaS vendors' perspective, the creation of sustainable software licenses remains a pertinent and yet elusive goal in the near term' | Page 6: 'We argue this strategy is not sustainable for SaaS vendors in the long run because it may cause neglect to the importance of the alignment between license and client's value'",
