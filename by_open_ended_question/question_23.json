PaaS offers differ notably in their core value proposition which has a direct impact on the corresponding CVP. (2.) Which governance model a PaaS provider is using affects the CVP. For instance, presumably an open governance model is more attractive for potential customers. The next two features (3.) technical scope and (4.) additional services both influence the CVP positively and will gain strength over time through platform improvements. (5.) the platform improvements itself improve the CVP, through capabilities not considered in other influence factors. And finally (6.), the market penetration in the form of a company's brand image and reputation supports the CVP'",
