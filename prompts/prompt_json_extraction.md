  "question_text": "[Full question text]",
  "response_found": true/false,
  "extracted_value": "[Normalized response according to question format]",
  "synonyms_found": ["term1", "term2", "term3"],
  "source_citation": "[Location and direct quote from article]",
  "confidence_level": "high/medium/low"
}
```

### FIELD SPECIFICATIONS:

**response_found** (Boolean):
- `true`: The article contains sufficient information to answer the question
- `false`: The article does not contain relevant information for this question

**extracted_value** (Text/List):
- Provide the normalized answer according to the question's specified format
- For single-selection questions: provide one value from the controlled vocabulary
- For multiple-selection questions: provide array of values
- For open text questions: provide concise descriptive text
- Use "not reported" when response_found is false

**synonyms_found** (Array):
- List all original terms from the article that refer to the same concept
- Include variations, alternative names, and equivalent expressions
- Leave empty array [] if no synonyms are found

**source_citation** (Text):
- Format: "Page X, Section Y: 'Direct quote from article'"
- If no page numbers: "Section/Paragraph N: 'Direct quote'"
- **CRITICAL: Must directly support the extracted_value - reader should be able to find or deduce the answer from this citation**
- Include sufficient context for verification - prefer longer relevant citations over shorter ones
- Multiple sources: separate with " | "
- **The extracted_value must be traceable to this citation - no external knowledge allowed**

**confidence_level** (Categorical):
- `high`: Clear, explicit information directly matching the question
- `medium`: Information present but requires some interpretation
- `low`: Information is implied or requires significant inference

## EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:

### EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS:
- Read the entire article thoroughly before starting extraction
- Look for information in all sections: abstract, introduction, methodology, results, discussion, conclusions
- Consider tables, figures, and appendices when mentioned
- Don't skip any question - mark as "not reported" if truly absent

### SYNONYM HANDLING:
- Identify all terms that refer to the same business model concept
- Normalize to the most appropriate standard term
- Preserve original terminology in synonyms_found array
- Handle abbreviations, acronyms, and technical jargon

### SOURCE TRACEABILITY:
- Always provide specific location (page, section, paragraph)
- Include direct quotes - no paraphrasing in source_citation
- Use quotation marks for exact text from article
- If information spans multiple locations, cite the most relevant passage

### QUALITY ASSURANCE:
- Prioritize explicit information over inferences
- Distinguish between what is stated vs. what is suggested
- When multiple options apply, include all relevant ones
- Maintain consistency in terminology throughout extraction

## CRITICAL EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:

### ULTRA-IMPORTANT TASKS - MUST BE DONE FOR EVERY EXTRACTION:

**SOURCE-EXTRACTED_VALUE ALIGNMENT:**
- ✅ **ALWAYS verify that source_citation directly supports the current question**
- ✅ **The reader must be able to find or logically deduce extracted_value from source_citation**
- ✅ **extracted_value should be normalized according to question format BUT never invented**
- ✅ **Use direct excerpts from source_citation to compose extracted_value whenever possible**
- ✅ **Don't fear long source_citations if they are relevant and answer the question**

**FORBIDDEN PRACTICES:**
- ❌ **NEVER invent information not present in source_citation**
- ❌ **NEVER use external knowledge to fill gaps**
- ❌ **NEVER include terms in extracted_value that cannot be traced to source_citation**
- ❌ **NEVER provide generic business model descriptions unless explicitly stated in the article**

### EXAMPLES OF INCORRECT EXTRACTIONS TO AVOID:

**BAD EXAMPLE 1** - Invented Business Model Canvas elements:
```json
"extracted_value": [
  "Value Proposition: Professional design tools with cloud-based collaboration",
  "Customer Segment: Creative professionals, enterprises"
],
"source_citation": "Page 5: 'The new provisioning model positioned Adobe to deliver more capabilities'"
```
❌ The extracted_value contains detailed Business Model Canvas descriptions not present in the source citation.

**BAD EXAMPLE 2** - Including terms not in source:
```json
"extracted_value": ["Creative Cloud", "subscription-based model"],
"source_citation": "Page 1: 'cloud and subscription-based pricing model'"
```
❌ "Creative Cloud" appears in extracted_value but is absent from source_citation.

**CORRECT APPROACH:**
- Only extract what is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the source text
- If Business Model Canvas elements are mentioned, extract exactly what is said, not what they typically contain
- Include in extracted_value only terms that appear in or can be logically derived from source_citation

## TODO CHECKLIST:

Before submitting your response, verify:

- [ ] All 33 questions have been processed
- [ ] Each JSON object contains all 6 required fields
- [ ] No question is marked as "not applicable" - use false + "not reported" instead
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Every source_citation directly supports its extracted_value**
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Reader can find or deduce extracted_value from source_citation**
- [ ] **CRITICAL: No invented information in extracted_value**
- [ ] All true responses have corresponding source citations with quotes
- [ ] Confidence levels are assigned consistently
- [ ] Synonyms are captured when present
- [ ] Multiple-choice questions use arrays when multiple values apply
- [ ] Controlled vocabularies are respected (don't create new categories)
- [ ] Source citations are specific enough for verification
- [ ] JSON syntax is valid and complete

## FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT:

IMPORTANT: Create a file named <article-id>_extraction.json

```json
{
  "extraction_metadata": {
    "article_title": "[Article title if mentioned]",
    "extraction_date": "[Current date]"
  },
  "extracted_data": [
    {
      "question_id": "1",
