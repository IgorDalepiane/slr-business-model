Another research direction is to study the case when the parameter β is heterogeneous among customers. Finally, some firms such as Online network disk provider SugarSync often first choose the freemium model for marketing, then utilize the charge-for-everything model after the market share has been obtained. Thus, investigating the dynamic decisions of the freemium model and the charge-for-everything model would be an interesting future research topic.'",
