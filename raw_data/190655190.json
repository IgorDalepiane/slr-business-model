Three main variations: (1) Reciprocal License Model (copyleft-based, service-oriented revenue from professional services), (2) Academic License Model (permissive licenses allowing proprietary derivatives, revenue from licensing and services), (3) Dual Business Model (offering both open source and proprietary licenses, revenue mainly from license fees).",
